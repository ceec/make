        <h2>London and Paris Trip</h2>

        <h3>Wednesday, June 25</h3>
<p>We got to London's Heathrow Airport around 10:30 AM their time (so about 5:30am EST). It was nice to finally get off the plane since we were stuck on it FOREVER.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>We wandered around the airport for a while. It was HUGE! (sorry Billy Fuccillo) The one we left from in Ottawa had seven terminals, this one must have seven hundred.</p>
<p>We finally found the Undergound station after Many moving floors and escalators.</p>
<p>Our hotel was on Queensborgh Terrance near Bayswater street.</p>
<p>We got there around one (we were on the Underground hopelessly lost for a while) and checked in. Allison and I are in room 707. </p>
<p>We took a nap since we both had major jet lag (you try sleeping on that plane). Around 3, we left to go out into London.</p>
<p>We caught a red doubledecker bus a couple of blocks down the street and took it to around Oxford Street. I was having a good time seeing all the Mini Coopers, Audi TTs, Smart Cars, and any other cute looking car. :)</p>
<p>Well, we got off the bus and wandered around for a while. I saw a Swatch store and a sock store. Swatch!!!!</p>
<p>Allison wanted to go see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang that was playing in the Pallidium. We walked down into theatre district and found a tickets place.</p>
<p>Allison's dad wanted to see some other play then another.</p>
<p>Finally we bought tickets for My Fair Lady. Allison wanted to see it before it closed.</p>
<p>We then ate dinner at a pub place. I had Taco's no I had Nacho's (I was distracted by the tv). After we ate we wandered around the place we were in, I'm not sure what it was called but there was a lot of theaters.</p>
<p>We finally found the theater iit was in the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane.</p>
<p>We sat in the upper circle. The theater was a real one, with boxes and a balcony and fancy salons and staircases. The play was really good and I liked it. Afterwards we wandered around some more and made it back to the hotel.</p>
<h3>Thursday, June 26</h3>
<p>We had breakfast at the hotel and left for the British Museum. We wandered around looking for it for a while and then eventually did.</p>
<p>It's a huge museum, huge! The grand court was entirely made out of marble.</p>
<p>We went into the Egypt exhibit (the museum was free, all national museums are here, the lottery pays for it) and there were masses of small schoolchildren.</p>
<p>The Rosetta Stone was there and a bunch of other Egyptian stuff. There was a lot of ancient culture matieral. The entire museum was full of it.</p>
<p>We left soon and wandered down a nearby street. We then had a fight (not really) about what we were going to have for lunch. No one could decide on anything. We ended up at a korean cafe type thing. I got a soda called Fanta.</p>
<p>I LOVE FANTA.</p>
<p>It's a German coca-cola soda that's ike orange-lemon stuff. I don't know. It's really good and I LOVE IT.</p>
<p>Well after that we headed towards Regents Park.</p>
<p>It was about a million degrees out and I had pants on. Allison's parents wanted to see A Midsummer's Ngiht Dream in the open air theatre. We bought tickets, then wandered around and look at the kids in school uniforms that were there.</p>
<p>We got to the theater to see our seats were in the sun. We sat there and watched the first half. Then we left because it was a million degrees out and the play was awful.</p>
<p>We wandered around then took the underground to Oxford Street to do some shopping.</p>
<p>We went back to the hotel and then to a little Indian Buffet. They had really good food!</p>
<h3>Friday June 27</h3>
<p>We had breakfast at the hotel again and then went to exchange some money. Then we went back to the hotel since it had started to rain. As soon as they got coats and umbrellas the rain stopped.</p>
<p>We then took the underground to London Bridge and walked around there for a while. There was another food fight and during that we found The Globe.</p>
<p>Richard III was playing and we got grounding tickets because they were only 5 pounds compared to 25 pounds for sitting tickets (My Fair Lady was 20 pounds).</p>

<p>We finally ate at the cafe at the Globe then waited around for the play to start at 2 o'clock. We stood right next to the right side of the stage so we could have something to lean on.</p>
<p>The play was really good and rather long, but being right next to the stage was interesting. Seeing a play in the Globe was completely different than in another theater.</p>
<p>Audience participation was encouraged but the crowd was shy at first, except for one guy upfront with a beer. He yelled "Kill him!" to Am(??) to kill Richard and the girl playing Richard took his beer and drank some of it.</p>
<p>Another thing was that the entire cast was girls. Instead of an entire cast of men it was an entire cast of women.</p>
<p>Christine the Play Critic gives Richard III at the Globe a 0.92 out of 1. It got boring in some parts but the fighting and good actresses made up for it.</p>
<p>After the Globe, we walked along the Thames some more and the Tate Museum of Modern Art. Allison and I walked through the Modern Galleries of Still Life on the 3rd floor. I saw a painting by Pollock, Cezanne, and Matisse.</p>
<p>Then we hit the gift shop. After that we went to the temmpas (tapas) cafe. I ordered chicken croquet (croquette) and I liked it!<br>
Muha!</p><br>
<p>Afterwards we crossed the Thames on a pedestrian bridge and walked for a bit on the other side of the river. We then caught a bus for Oxford Street and just rode it around looking at everything. There were a lot of pret restaurants and Pizza Huts EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>We made our way back to the hotel area and went to a nice Italian restaurant on Queensway Street. I had some really good pizza there.</p>
<h3>Saturday June 28</h3>
<p>We had breakfast in the hotel and then we went back to the room to get our dirty clothes so they can be washed. We did so and went with Allison's mom over to Queensway. She took the clothes and Allison and I crossed the street to look into this shop we wanted to look at.</p>
<p>It was closed so we went to look for Allison's mom. We couldn't find the laundry mat so we wandered back up the street to see that the store, Punky Fish, was open.</p>
<p>We went in and looked around. It looked like it was going to be a cheap shop but it wasn't. We crossed the street in disappointment. We went into another store and we were excited to see prices of &pound; 2 and 4.</p>
<p>Allison bought some things and then we went to look for her mom again. We couldn't find her so we went into the mall across the street. We went into some stores then walked up and down the street some more looking for this laundry mat. We went a little further and there it was.</p>
<p>We went back tot he hotel and picked up Allison's dad. Then we took the underground to Notting Hill Gate and headed towards Portabello Road.</p>
<p>We lurked amongst the shops and looked at things. Allison got a T-shirt and I got a change pursey thing. Then we both bought extremely cool Japanese wallets. After walkeding back up Notting Hill we  went to a greek restaurant. I ordered some chicken. I had some calamari too.We then picked up our luggage and called for a taxis to take us to Heathrow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it wasn't a cool London taxis, but it was a nice black mercedes-benz with black leather. The driver was from Iran and really nice.</p>
<p>At the airport we got on a plane. It was a small plane and only about half of it was full.</p>
<p>We took off into the sky and flew towards la manche (English Channel).</p>
<p>We had to change our watches since Paris was an hour ahead of England.</p>
<p>We landed in Charles De Gaulle airport and walked down some stairs to get off the plane because we weren't good enough for the airport.</p>
<p>We took a bus to get to the extremely chic and modern future-esque airport.</p>
<p>I want to live there.</p>
<p>After we got into the airport a moth flew around me. Taking mercy on this poor creature, I tried to catch the moth but, alas, I did not prevail and the moth flew out of my reach.</p>
<p>We got our bags and had taxi problems.</p>
<p>At the hotel we are in room 102. We take the stairs because we are good citizens and know not to waste energy, so the planet will live.</p>
<p>Instead of having mattresses the hotel kindly provided us with two giant foam blocks.</p>
<p>Then we slept.</p>
<h3>Sunday 29 de Juin</h3>
<p>We had breakfast in the cellar of the hotel.</p>
<p>Then we left to find the American Express office. We walked to some random subway stop that happened to be Montparnasse. We bought metro passes and took the train to the Arc de Triumph.</p>
<p>It was about a million degrees out and the American Express office was no where to be seen.</p>
<p>I wanted to go up on top of the Arc, so we did. Unfortunately, their were a million stairs inbetween the Christine and the top of the arc (280-ish).</p>
<p>I climbed them without stopping once. Yeah!</p>
<p>The top gave us a grand view of Paris. </p>
<p>We climbed back down the stairs and back into the heat.</p>
<p>Then we went to the Louvre. We left Allison's parents and went off after we found out that the Code of Hammurabi was closed for the day. Allison's parents were much slower than us so we just met up again later.</p>
<p>We first went to look at the Mona Lisa (La Joconde) cause its famous and all. We wandered through the Louvre and looked at the paintings along the way since the Mona Lisa was at the other end of the building.</p>
<p>We finally got there and it was surrounded by a large crowd of people. It wasn't too amazing or anything and it seemed rather small.</p>
<p>We left there and wandered into some other room with these really funny Catholic paintings.</p>
<p>Then we tried to find the crown jewels of Louis XV. The stairs were hidden but we finally found them.</p>
<p>They weren't too spectacular they looked like pieces of colored glass glued onto some cloth or made by a 5 year old.</p>
<p>After that we wandered into a dark cool place. We were hot so it seemed logical to go there. There were some stones and we continued to walk. Somehow we ended up in the old moat of the old Louvre from like 1200 or 900 or really old.</p>
<p>It was really cool in there (ha HA!). There were these dungeons at the end that were cool too.</p>
<p>We headed back to the center pyramid to meet with Allison's parents.</p>
<p>They hadn't seen the Jaconde so we waited some more.</p>
<p>They finally came and we went back into the heat. We wandered around some more and I saw these GIANT pigeons. They were like twice the size of normal ones.</p>
<p>We finally went back to the hotel around 5 and didn't want to go out again.</p>
<p>We stayed in our room and watched some quality French TV while Allison's parents went back out.</p>
<p>There was a really good and funny show on this one channel. Where this guy did stupid things but the way he did them were so funny. That show ended and we were devastated.</p>
<p>Then a movie came on and we were excited. It turned out to be The Fast and the Furious dubbed in French. </p>
<p>Allison nor I had ever seen it so we watched it and ate peanut butter.</p>
<p>Since it was in French we had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>Apparently guy in red truck got beat up by messy guy and then Henri the ring leader broke it up. Then they raced cars and red truck guy had a green car that lost. Then his green car blew up. He magically got an orange car by the next scene and turned out to be the police or  something. Someone had a little sister in all of this mess also.</p>
<p>Then Henri the ring leader went to hijack another truck and red truck guy took some girl with them. Messy guy got cloned somehow and got stuck to the side of the truck.</p>
<p>Then red truck guy was left in a field.</p>
<p>It should have ended there so I am going to stop writing about it.</p>
<p>Then a funny commercial show came on.</p>
<p>Then we slept.</p>
<h3>Monday June 30</h3>
<p>We had breakfast in the cellar again. Allison and I wanted to go to the museum in the Sardin des Plants to see dinosaurs but somehow we ended up going to the Picasso museum. Allison and I made our way through fast and then took up residence on a nice bench.</p>
<p>PIcasso is one of my least favorite painters anyway. After leaving that, we wandered Paris for a while and found this nice little cafe.</p>
<p>They had really nice lemonaid like they gave you a little glass of lemon juice, a pitcher of water, and a sugar thing-bowl.</p>
<p>Then we walked to the Centre Pompidu.</p>
<p>Allison and I got in free again because we were under 18. We went through the museum. IT had some pretty interesting things, like this room you went into that was completely black with odd noises coming from inside it and these animal statues that had a light shine on them to Silent Night played by an out of tune violin.</p>
<p>After that we went back to the hotel and watched some TV.</p>
<p>We left the hotel again and headed towards the big fancy church on the mountain also known as Sacre Coeur (Sacred Heart).</p>
<p>We wandered around fighting over where to eat as usual and saw the steps from Amelie.</p>
<p>We finally ate at this outdoors place.</p>
<p>I had some odd cheese pizza with motenral??, goat cheese, and something that tasted like cheddar.</p>
<p>I ate most of it and then we place across from us got rowdy and the people started singing Hotel California loudly and out of key. Maybe because it was a piano bar.</p>
<p>We finished, got lost, and ended up on the fanicular or something that was a car that brought us down the mountain.</p>
<p>Then we slept.</p>
<h3>Tuesday July 1st</h3>
<p>Another wonderful breakfast in the cellar. Then we had a chat with newsie boy who wouldn't believe that LA (where he lived) was better than Oswego.</p>
<p>We then took the RER train to musee d'orsay and after waiting in line for 5 minutes, left Allison's dad there and took the RER train to versailles.</p>
<p>We walked towards the place and instantly realized why Louis XIV wasted all of France's money building it.</p>
<p>We got a free audio tour and walked through the kings, queens, dauphain and dolphine's quarters. We then went outside and met with France's crazy weather. There was blue sky with big puffy clouds that you think were harmless but oh no, we were looking for the cafe when it randomly starts pouring like crazy so we ran into a gift shop.</p>
<p>Five minutes later it was blue sky.</p>
<p>After some more rain dodging we headed towards the gardens.</p>
<p>They were huge!!!!</p>
<p>[picture]</p>
<p>We wandered around and found a little cafe place. I got a goufre (waffle) and some fanta. Then we wandered into the baths of apollo or something. I don't know, it was beautiful.</p>
<p>I would have taken a picture but i had managed with my skill to break it (the camera) at the Louvre.</p>
<p>It started to rain again so we ran up this little path into the woods. We came back out and stood under a tree to stay out of the crazy French rain.</p>
<p>A gardener came through and told us we weren't supposed to be there so we left and he followed us out. Heheheheh ^^;;</p>
<p>We then took the RER train back to Paris and met Allison's dad a l'hotel.</p>
<p>He said he had found this nice little cafe place for dinner so we went there but it didn't open for two more hours.</p>
<p>So we left for Notre Dame.</p>
<p>I got completely soaked on the way thanks to my friend the French weather and we finally made it to the church.</p>
<p>It was big. And completely made of stone. There was mass going on with some singers from Taihiti.</p>
<p>We left and took le metero back to Alicia and walked to the nice cafe.</p>
<p>During the period we were on the subway, the rain stopped and the temperature had dropped 20 degrees.</p>
<p>I got some good chicken stuff with potatoes.</p>
<p>Allisons mom got something that had something very odd on it ( pig livers or hearts).</p>
<p>Then i got my coat and we took the RER train to the Tour Effil.</p>
<p>When we first saw it, it was SO pretty. There were all these strobe lights on it that were all flashing like.</p>
<p>They stopped though, much to my disappointment. We reached the bottom of the tower and were once again bombarded by men from Africa who, I swear, could only speak a few words in French.</p>
<p>Umbrella, Versailles, Post card.</p>
<p>Well anywho, we took the elevator up to the second level since it was 10:30PM and the top had closed.</p>
<p>There was a really pretty view of Paris from up there.</p>
<p>We took the elevator back down and then took the RER train to the metro and then went back to our foam blocks.</p>
<h3>Wednesday July 2nd</h3>
<p>We had our last breakfast in the cellar and then dragged our bags halfway across Paris to Montparnasse train station. There was a convient [sp] flight bus to the airport there that we took.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we took the bus to the wrong terminal so we had to walk the entire length of CDG airport and we even had to walk on the moving floors cause it was 11 something and our plane left at noon or something.</p>
<p>Well, we got on the plane and half an hour later we were back at Heathrow.</p>
<p>The original plan was to take a taxi to Greenwich but oh no, we had to take the o-so-wonderful underground. I'm not saying it was bad but let me draw: </p>
<p>[drawing]</p>
<p>It took a good hour and a half to finally get to Greenich and then we had to find the bed and breakfast.</p>
<p>Allison and I just wanted to sleep but we needed food as I hadn't eaten all day.</p>
<p>We ventured out of the b&b and went to the nearest restaurant.</p>
<p>We wanted to go back to the B&B but Allison's parents dragged us to the college.</p>
<p>After another 45 minutes on a bus we arrived at the college.</p>
<p>We took up residence on a bench and ate cheddar cheese.</p>
<p>After a while we got back on the bus (HAHA SWEEN???????) and went back to the B&B. (We had to catch our nightly shows of Big Brother and V Graham Norton) (It seems as after Tania left, Cameron came back and Lisa came too.)</p>
<h3>Thursday July 3</h3>
<p>Allison's dad had a conference thing until noon so the three of us left wandered Greenich. We went into some stores and walked around the flea market. We went into the Maratime Museum for about 20 minutes but then we had to leave because we had to meet Allison's dad.</p>
<p>Allison and I convinced her mom to let us take the DLR into London and wander around.</p>
<p>We went to Picadilly Circus looking for a cool store we had walked by when we were here earlier. Allison and I felt rebellious so we had lunch/dinner at PIzza Hut on Picadilly Circus.</p>
<p>Afterwards we wandered about looking for that store.</p>
<p>There was this long line of people outside of this book store and we thought it was odd so we went back to see what was going on.</p>
<p>Apparently Hillary Clinton was going to be there at 6. We thought the line was sad because it was 3ish.</p>
<p>We wandered in a direction that I thought Oxford Street was in. We got lost (well not really since we knew we could just turn around and walk back down to Picadilly Circus).</p>
<p>Somehow we ended up on New Bond Street. We wandered up that for a while heading for what I thought was Oxford Street. We came to a dead end and turned, somehow ending up on Regent Street.</p>
<p>We continued down that for a while until we ended up at the shop I had given up on finding. It wasn't cool anyway.</p>
<p>We took the Underground/DLR and went back to the B&B. Allison's parents wanted us back at 7 and we were there at 6:15ish.</p>
<p>Allison's parents werent back yet so we  hung out in the room. We watched our shows again and then slept.</p>
<h3>Friday July 4</h3>
<p>Allison's dad has his conference thing again so the three of us left and went back to the Maratime museum. Well just allison and me. It was really cool!</p>
<p>Then we met backup with allison's mom and walked to greenwhich observatory which was ontop of the steepest hill in the world.</p>
<p>[picture]</p>
<p>I stood on the Prime Meridian for a while then wandered through the boring museum and sat with Allison on a bench.</p>
<p>Her mom soon came and we had Mexican for lunch. Then we went into London on the National Rail train, but it wasn't a real train cause it had no engine.</p>
<p>We went to Charing Cross )well the train line ended there so there was really no choice)</p>
<p>We took the underground to South Kengsington and Allison and I went into the National History Museum while her mom did something.</p>
<p>The NH museum was cool and had a lot of stuffed animals and shiny gemstones.</p>
<p>We met her mom at the cloakroom and then walked to Harrods.</p>
<p>That place was amazing. We went into the food halls and bought some cheese and baguettes. Then we went into the candy area. It was like a dream. They had a Jelly Belly center with every flavor imaginable in tubes behind the counter. We bought some fudge and then left.</p>
<p>We took the DLR back to Greenwhich, well really Canary Wharf cause I wanted to but the Sun and some Fanta and the English version of the new Harry Potter book (or tome since its a MILLION PAGES long. Well Allison and I co-own it, &pound;11 isn't bad.</p>
<p>Well, ALL THE STORES WERE CLOSED SINCE it was about 8:30PM. Well we went back to the B&B and ate our Harrods food.</p>
<p>There was some Greenwhich festival thing but we were too tired to get dressed again. SO we slept.</p>
<h3>Saturday July 5</h3>
<p>We had to switch B&Bs today so we got a taxi to take us out into the middle of nowhere in New Elton.</p>
<p>Allison's dad went off to his conference and the three of us left and went into London.</p>
<p>We headed to Picadilly Circus to find the Rainforest cafe that was there. We ate and wandered around. We went into the HIllary Clinton bookstore.</p>
<p>We bought some books, including the 80 pound new Harry Potter book.</p>
<p>We left there and wandered around looking for Trafalgar square.</p>
<p>We found it then got on the subway to OXford street where we found the COOLEST store in the world.</p>
<p>TOPSHOP</p>
<p>It was HUGE. It took up a whole block and had about 5 floors. They had these extremely cool kangaroo shoes that i liked. ALlison managed to get lost and we looked for her. 45 minutes later we found her and then went to the cafe for a break.  I ordered a chocolate muffin but somehow got a chocolate croissant. I didn't really care it was good.</p>
<p>We went back in Topshop and i wanted to buy those cool blue kangaroos but no… they only had size 3. I was a 7.5 in UK side so they were out of the picture. </p>
<p>Then we headed to The Globe to meet Allison's dad. He wanted to see some play that was playing but as we got there we found out it wasn't playing.</p>
<p>Allison's dad showed up with a friend named Claire and then we went to this Turkish restaurant.</p>
<p>Claire had a car and offered to drive us home which was nice.</p>
<p>We got lost trying to find New Elthan but we eventually found it at 10:29 and Allison and I rushed upstairs to watch V Graham Norton, but HE WASNT ON!</p>
<p>Devastated, I went to bed in the cave.</p>
<h3>Sunday July 6</h3>
<p>We went off into London around noon after we laid around all morning. We got on the train only to have it break down. We got on another one and got off at Waterloo station. We had pizza hut again and then went back to Top Shop where I bought an extremely cool backpack.</p>
<p>Allison wanted to go back to Queensway and since we had an hour before our train left, we went there. I had managed to loose my subway pass so I bought another one and we went to Queensway. The skirt Allison had wanted had been marked down to &pound; 2 from &pound; 4 so she bought two.</p>
<p>We headed back to Charing Cross to catch our train that supposedly left at 4:46, but when we got there at like 4:45 it had already gone.</p>
<p>That was okay because another one left at 5:12. We got on that train and went back to the B&B at about 5:50, when we were supposed to be back at 6.</p>
<p>Allisons parents had the banquet and we hung out in the room eating peanut butter.</p>
<p>Then we slept.</p>
<h3>Monday July 7</h3>
<p>We got another taxi to take us to the City airport so we could get our rental car. We got a blue Puegot. We got lost for a while and then finally ended up on the M4 headed towards Sailsbury. </p>
<p>We eventually got there and found a parking lot by Sailsbury cathedral. It was nice and there was a copy of the magna carta.</p>
<p>We were back in the car and headed back out in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>As we were driving down the highway i looked up and saw these stones.
Stonehenge.</p>
<p>We stayed there for a while and then left and went into the car.</p>
<p>We looked for a bed and breakfast for a while and then found one.</p>
<p>The lady there said there was a nice pub nearby so we went to that.</p>
<p>Afterwards we drove into LaCock where a scene from Harry Potter had been filmed. We walked around there and then drove back to the B&B.</p>
<p>And then we slept.</p>
<h3>Tuesday July 8</h3>
<p>We left the B&B and headed to Avebury to see its stonehenge. The one there is much bigger than stonehenge and you can climb on the rocks.</p>
<p>We wandered around and then Allison's dad pointed out what looked like a crop circle in the field across the road.</p>
<p>It was one two [spelled like that]!!</p>
<p>We wandered around some more and then we got back in the car.</p>
<p>We headed towards Oxford but her parents wanted to go see a white horse so we spent a couple of hours driving around out into the middle of nowhere to find it. They looked at the horse then we were back in the car headed towards Oxford.</p>
<p>We got there and found this pub place to eat in.</p>
<p>Apparently JR Tolkien and CS Lewis had gone there every dat to talk about beer (Hmm maybe that is why the first LOR book has many conversations about beer.) </p>
[was i referencing the hobbit here, i dont think i ever read the first lord of the rings book?????? How did i even know about the movies didnt they not come out to senior year??????? LOL NO 2001]
<p>We left the pub and Allisons parents went to the American Express office and Allison and I stayed in the car. Allison had been reading some book she bought and I read the TOME.</p>
<p>After Oxford we got lost and ended up in Stratford-upon-Avon. We wandered around and saw where Shakespeare was born.</p>
<p>Luckily it was closed so we went to yet another pub for dinner.</p>
<p>We left and decided we needed to find a B&B since it was about 7pm.</p>
<p>We got onto the M4 (or something) and took a random exit off and there was a B&B.</p>
<p>It didn't have TVs in all of the rooms but it had a nice big one in a downstairs TV room. Allison and I watched our last Graham Norton with Leggy as guest.</p>
<p>Then we went to bed.</p>
<h3>Wednesday July 9</h3>
<p>We left the B&B around 9 and headed towards Heathrow.</p>
<p>Our plane left at 3:15 and we got to the airport around 10:30</p>
[AC0889  To Ottawa, Canada           C-FCAF     763 09/07/2003 15:36]
<p>Having 5 hours to do nothing, we sat around. There was a TGI Fridays there and Allison and I had lunch there.</p>
<p>We finished and our plane was boarding. </p>
<p>We got onto it and I had a window seat. We sat in the back-ish area of the plane so there was NO giant screen in front of us.</p>
<p>We arrived at Ottawa Airport around 5:45, two and a half hours after we left (but 7 hours later) We took the trolley transports-o thing to the Park N Fly parking lot and got the car.</p>
<p>It was extremely odd, not driving on the other side of the road.</p>
<p>We drove by the mushroom farm and I think I fell asleep a few minutes later cause next thing I knew Allison's mom was waking us up for customs.</p>
<p>After that we drove and I was half awake, and I think I fell asleep again cause her parents were stopping at the Golden Fish Place in that city.</p>
<p>I drifted off yet again but woke  up outside of Oswego and stayed awake.</p>
<p>We arrived home around 10:30pm but more like 3:30am to me.</p>
<p>I got inside and all i could manage to do was blabber about random things cause i was really tired.</p>
